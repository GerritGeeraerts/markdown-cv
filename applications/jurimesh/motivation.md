Dear Hiring Team at Jurimesh, 

I am excited to apply for the ML/LLM Engineer role at Jurimesh. My passion for AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), drives my belief in their transformative power to reshape how we work. With over 10 years experience in IT and recent training as a Data Engineer at BeCode, Iâ€™ve honed expertise in Python, LLMs, RAG. At SUMSUM, I built interactive RAG demos, and a agent based chatbot.  

I am genuinely enthusiastic about your team's mission and confident that my combination of technical expertise, passion, and drive to enhance productivity makes me a strong fit for this role. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs further.

Kind regards,
Gerrit Geeraerts
