Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to express my strong interest in the Internship in Data Science position at your company. With my
background in system engineering and my recent training in data engineering at Becode, I believe I possess the skills
and passion to make a valuable contribution to your team.

Throughout my career, I have excelled in system engineering roles, where I learned to integrate and optimize various
systems and platforms to create efficient and user-friendly toolsets. This experience has taught me the importance
of understanding the end-user's needs and delivering solutions that enhance productivity and streamline workflows.

In addition to my professional experience, I am a tech enthusiast who enjoys exploring new technologies and working
on projects in my free time. Recognizing the transformative power of AI and its ability to create even more capable
tools, I made the decision to pursue a full-time course in Data Engineering at Becode. This decision was driven by my
desire to acquire the necessary skills to build innovative tools that empower people to be more productive.

The projects and technologies listed in the vacancy description align perfectly with my interests and expertise. I am
particularly excited about the opportunity to apply my knowledge of Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to real-world use cases. Furthermore, I am eager to expand my knowledge in these areas and contribute
to the development and improvement of existing projects and putting them into production.

With my passion for technology, my ability to work both independently and collaboratively, and my commitment to
continuous learning, I am confident in my ability to make a meaningful impact during this internship. I am excited
about the prospect of joining a fast-growing start-up environment and contributing to the success of your Finance
department and other teams.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and enthusiasm
for this role in more detail.

Sincerely,
Gerrit Geeraerts
