## About Me
`-`
I first got in touch with computers when I was 7 years old, Windows 3.11 in the full 16 colors, magical! Since then, 
I have been passionate about technology. With a core value to leverage the abilities of computers to make our lives more 
productive. I have been personally inspired by this for over 30 years, working on numerous home projects. 
Professionally, I have about 1 decade of experience in IT. Most of it was as a system engineer, exploring and learning 
new systems and connecting them through coding. 

But today, I see more potential in Data & Artificial Intelligence. It has the power to make a bigger difference in our 
productivity. This inspired me to pursue a training at BeCode as a Data Engineer.

As a person, I am a collaborative team player with a passion for continuous learning and knowledge sharing. 
Motivated, a creative problem-solver, leveraging critical thinking and analytical skills to find robust solutions. 
I am a generalist with a broad interest range.

My goal now is to grow and apply my technical expertise as a Data Engineer to build robust **LLM**ops 
solutions that leverage the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence.
